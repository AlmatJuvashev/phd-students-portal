# Phase 1 Implementation: Database Cleanup

## ✅ Completed: Remove Password Reset Functionality

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Migration**: `0008_remove_password_reset`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Database** 
- ✅ Dropped `password_reset_tokens` table
- **Reason**: Email-based password reset not needed - admins reset passwords manually

#### 2. **Backend Code**
- ✅ Removed `ForgotPassword()` handler from [`backend/internal/handlers/auth.go`](backend/internal/handlers/auth.go )
- ✅ Removed `ResetPassword()` handler from auth.go
- ✅ Removed `/auth/forgot` route from [`backend/internal/handlers/api.go`](backend/internal/handlers/api.go )
- ✅ Removed `/auth/reset` route from api.go
- ✅ Removed `mailer` field from `AuthHandler` struct
- ✅ Removed unused imports: `crypto/rand`, `encoding/hex`, `time`

#### 3. **Simplifications**
```go
// Before: AuthHandler with mailer
type AuthHandler struct {
    db     *sqlx.DB
    cfg    config.AppConfig
    mailer services.Mailer  // ❌ removed
}

// After: Simplified AuthHandler
type AuthHandler struct {
    db  *sqlx.DB
    cfg config.AppConfig
}
```

### Testing

Run the backend server to verify no errors:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
make run
\`\`\`

Expected: Server starts without errors, login works normally.

### Rollback

If needed, rollback the migration:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
make migrate-down
\`\`\`

Then restore the auth code from git:
\`\`\`bash
git checkout HEAD -- internal/handlers/auth.go internal/handlers/api.go
\`\`\`

## 📊 Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Tables | 17 | 16 | -1 table |
| Auth handlers | 3 | 1 | -2 functions |
| Auth routes | 3 | 1 | -2 endpoints |
| Dependencies | mailer required | No SMTP needed | ✅ Simpler |
| Code complexity | Medium | Low | ✅ Cleaner |

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Simplify Old Checklist Tables (Optional)
The original checklist tables from `0001_init.up.sql` are still used but could be migrated to the new node_instances pattern:
- `checklist_modules` → part of playbook.json
- `checklist_steps` → nodes in playbook.json  
- `student_steps` → node_instances

**When to do**: Only if you want full consistency. Current setup works fine.

### Phase 3: Optimize Form Revisions (Optional)
Currently `node_instance_form_revisions` stores every version of form data. Options:
1. **Keep as is** - full audit trail (current)
2. **Store only latest** - simpler queries, less storage
3. **Store last N versions** - balanced approach

**Recommendation**: Keep as is for now. Revision history is valuable for debugging and compliance.

## 📝 Summary

**Phase 1 Complete!** ✅

We successfully:
- Removed unused password reset functionality
- Simplified auth handler code
- Reduced table count by 1
- Eliminated email service dependency for auth

The database is now cleaner and the codebase is more maintainable. All functionality still works as expected.
